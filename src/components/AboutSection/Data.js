    headline: "Hello there, and welcome! I'm a highly motivated & energetic web developer with high passion for coding & web design. I was first introduced to coding at the age of 23 by a friend of mine who recommended looking into Codecademy. I've always had great interest in how applications & websites function & the work it takes behind the scenes to make them operate the way they do. I am proud to say that I have officially made the switch in order in making my dream a reality. ",
